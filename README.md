# myWeather ☀️
---
As a fan of outdoor sports, I'm interested in knowing what the weather is like in the places I go. The purpose of this project is to tell you what the weather will be like at the location you indicate.


## But how? 👩‍💻

I will use a free API from https://rapidapi.com/blog/openweathermap-api-overview/go/ so we will only be able to do current searches (at the moment no forecast over time 😆).The language chosen for this has been Go.

## Contributing🤝
